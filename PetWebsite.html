    <h2>Brief Description of my Pet</h2>
    <p>I have a dog called Blacky as my pet.</p>
    <p>Blacky is part of a breed of dogs called "Alaskan  Malamute"</p>
    <p>Here are some of his characteristics:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Black</strong> and <em>White</em> in Colour</li>
    <li>Is almost 8 months old</li>
    <li>Weighs around 20kgs</li>
    <li>Doesn't listen to anything I tell him</li>
    <li><strong>Stubborn</strong> as hell</li>
    <li>Takes bribes like meat from thieves with open arms.Such a corrupt dog</li>
    <li>Runs only when it wants to</li>
    <li>Protects me,well sometimes</li>
    <li>If he had money and a passport he would probably fly back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska">Alaska<a/>, this hot weather isn't for him</li>
  </ol>
  <p>I bet you're probably waiting for me to say how I love Blacky but sadly this isn't one of those stories. I should have gotten a horse. Heck,Thanos should have snapped that dog to the afterlife(Lool-how do you put emojis here?)</p>
